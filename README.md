**M5Stack-SAM brings MULTI FUNCTIONALITY to the M5Stack !!**

Loaded on the M5Stack, the SAM provides access to a number of applications that would normally be loaded as individual sketches. Applications are listed below. SAM also allows access to system info and some settings.
<br />

The Main Menu provides access to three sections:   Applications,  System,  &  Configuration.
<br />
<br />

**Applications:**

	DHT12 Sensor display - Temperature / Humidity
	Stopwatch
	I2C scanner
	Bluetooth BLE Beacon Simulator (iBeacon, Eddystone TLM + URL, ALTBeacon)
	QRCode Generator & QRCode Display
	GY-512 (MPU6050) - gyro/accelerometer (requires hardware mod + GY-512)
	SerialBridge - PASS-THRU USB <-> UART2
	WiFi Scanner 

**System:**
  
	Sleep / Charging Mode
	M5 System Info - CPU Speed, Flash Size, Flash SPEED, SDK Version

**Configuration:**

	Adjust display brightness   (conserves battery)

QRCode showing:

	QRPrint  (Visit the M5Stack website - "www.m5stack.com");
	QRCode can be changed - in Arduino IDE, with M5Stack-SAM.ino open, change data on the "Ã„PPS" tab - line 348.

Changes applied to this version:

	Authors name removed from main menu screen display on M5Stack (perhaps an About page could be added to the system section?).
	Added acknowledgement of author and contributors to the code pre-amble so it travels with the code.
	QRCode generated and displayed changed from authors name to M5Stack - www.m5stack.com
